Your first resource in this should be https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project
This file serves as your guide to help you get your contributions into any project on github.
Then you can take a look at the following contribution categories and take a look at the steps provided.
If you still have some questions or need help, feel free to open a discussion on the same.

# Contribution Categories

## Bug

Did you find a bug? Then you should open an issue on github.
Make sure to detail everything you know about the bug and potential solutions and suggestions if you have any.
The maintainers will look into it and debug it appropriately.
If you want to work on the bug yourself, then you can inform the maintainers for the same and work on it.
The steps for the same are detailed in the next category.

## Work on a bug/feature

Do you want to work on an issue/bug/feature? Great! Then you should take a look at all the information available about the issue/bug/feature.
You should first-of-all create a fork of the repo and work there. There you should create a new branch to work on it.
There you can commit your changes without disturbing the ongoing progress on other branches and repos.
When your work is done, you should open a Pull Request (PR) to merge your respective branch into the main branch.
On the PR thread feedback will be given by the maintainers and requests will be made, if any.
Make sure to follow those and commit to the same branch only. After your PR is reviewed by at least 1 person and the conflicts are resolved, it can be merged.
The maintainers will merge the PR themselves and then you can delete the branch, if there is no more work to be done on it.
Above steps also apply for documentation and other work.

## Other

Is there something else you want to talk about that isn't listed here, or doesn't belong to any of the above categories?
Feel free to open an issue on it. You can talk about it with the contributors and maintainers.
If the idea is out of scope or deemed unnecessary by the maintainers, it will be closed unanimously.
